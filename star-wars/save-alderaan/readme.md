#### * Note: It's better to learn by doing. For a more rewarding learning experience, try to use your own resources (a.k.a Google) to accomplish the requirements under [Create](https://github.com/juamatx/instructions/edit/main/star-wars/save-alderaan/readme.md#Create) . You can use this page to verify your final results. You will need to copy [User Data Script](https://github.com/juamatx/instructions/edit/main/star-wars/save-alderaan/readme.md#user-data-script) for the EC2 instance in us-east-1, the rest is wicked easy!

# Create: 
- 1 EC2 instance (us-east-1)
  - web server
- 1 EC2 instance (us-west-1)


## EC2 instance (us-east-1)

*This instance will host the web server.

- To start, open the EC2 page and click on "Launch Instances". Make sure to be in the **"us-east-1"** region.

#### Leave everything as default, only change the following:

- **Name:** The instance name can be anything you want, for this example it will be "Alderaan".

- **Key pair:** Typically, we create a key pair to connect to the instance but for this example we won't need to. Choose "proceed without a key pair"

- **Network settings:** a new  security group will be created, only check "Allow HTTP traffic from the internet". Why not HTTPS? our server will be only using HTTP. HTTPS requires a more involved setup. Typically we'd want security groups to be more strict and specific, but we will keep it minimal for the sake of simplicity

- **Advanced details:** paste the script below to the "User data" box. Then, "Launch Instance"

### User Data Script
This command script will run when the instance launches. Adding a script helps automate tasks to run before even connecting to the server (e.g. install software updates, change settings, add data/directories, etc)

This script will do the following:
 - Install updates
 - Install software to host a website (apache HTTP server)
 - Copy the home page of the website (a list of Rebel Alliance Bases)
```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>
TOP SECRET
</h1>
<h2>Rebel Alliance Bases:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dantooine</li>
<li>Yavin 4</li>
<li>Mako-Ta</li>
<li>Clabburn Range</li>
<li>5251977</li>
</ul>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

### Did it work?
After a few minutes, your instance should be ready to go. You should be able to access your server's web page by selecting your ec2 instance > opening the "details" tab > copy either the "Public IPv4 DNS" or "Public IPv4 address" and paste it in your browser's search bar. You should see the website below!

## EC2 instance (us-west-1)

Time to build the second server. This server won't be hosting anything initially.

Make sure to switch regions to **us-west-1**

Follow the same steps as before. The only exception :
- üîÑ Pick a different name. I will use "Dantooine"
- ‚ùå No need for the "User data" script

### We now have 2 instances running
1. Alderaan in **us-east-1** (web server)
2. Dantooine in **us-west-1**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è when the tutorial is over, make sure to "Terminate" both instances
